**Analyse Promotions & Provide Tangible Insights to Sales Director**

---

## 📝 Project Overview:

This Power BI project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of various promotional campaigns run by a retail company. By analyzing sales data before and after promotions, we derive actionable insights to help the Sales Director make data-driven decisions for future campaigns.

## 📁 Dataset Information:

The project uses four datasets:

* `dim_products.csv`: Product metadata (name, category)
* `dim_stores.csv`: Store details (store ID, city)
* `dim_campaigns.csv`: Campaign metadata (campaign name, start and end date)
* `fact_events.csv`: Transactional data, including promo type, quantities sold (before/after), base price, etc.

## 🎯 Key Business Objectives:

1. Identify which promotions led to the highest **Incremental Revenue (IR)**.
2. Measure **Incremental Sold Units (ISU)** across campaigns and product categories.
3. Discover **top- and bottom-performing stores** based on promotional impact.
4. Analyze **city-wise store performance** to uncover geographical trends.
5. Recommend promotions that strike the best balance between **unit uplift** and **margin health**.
